# MotorController

A simple and efficient motor controller project using PI4J Raspberry Pi for Java. The project has an LCD display to show the status of the motor and uses GPIO pins for controlling the motor's speed, direction, and duration. 

## Features

- Control DC motors with precision
- Supports PWM speed control
- Direction control (forward/reverse)
- Easy integration with microcontrollers
